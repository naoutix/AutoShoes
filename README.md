# Abstract
The recent development of automatic shoes could allow to benefit athletic players and create new features for shoes. Within the TIPE, I tried to rebuild the entire system of an automatic shoes. First I focus on the control of the lacing of the shoes, the sensors and the connectivity trough Bluetooth or manual buttons. Then, I looked for an Arduino microcontroller that I have programmed to coordinate them all. I built different methods and compare them each other to understand the problematic of these technology.
